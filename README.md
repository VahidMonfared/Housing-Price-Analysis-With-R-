# Dataset Details (Introduction)
To analyze housing prices based on various factors such as house area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, stories, proximity to the main road, presence of a guestroom, basement, hot water heating, air conditioning, parking facilities, preferred area, and furnishing status, involves a multifaceted approach to understand how each factor influences the overall price of a house (relations between variables). This type of analysis is crucial for several reasons, and achieving it requires a careful examination of the data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can inform buyers, sellers, real estate agents, and policymakers. Visualization of this data set can help a lot for mentioned targeted groups to better understating the analysis. The source of this Housing dataset belongs to "Kaggle".  "Housing data" dataset is clean, meaning it doesn't contain any common problems such as NaN (Not a Number) values, missing values, or scaling issues. The dataset is considered to be in good shape and format for the project it was used for.
Furthermore, it mentions that the project was carried out without major preprocessing steps, suggesting that the data was used in its original format without significant alterations or adjustments. This approach might be suitable depending on the specific goals and requirements of the project, as sometimes datasets are sufficiently clean and well-structured to be used without extensive preprocessing and wrangling.

- Consumer Preferences: Identifying which house features are most valued by buyers can guide developers and builders in constructing homes that meet market demands.

# Aims of the Analysis (Objective)
- Visualize and Determine the features that have the most significant impact on housing prices (relations among  variables with price).
- Analyzing the housing prices based on various features.
- Identify trends over time, such as rising prices in certain areas or preferences for specific house features.
- Segment the housing market into different categories based on price ranges and features.
- Data analytics for categorical and numerical variables
- To examine the distribution of the data
- Draw various random samples of the data and show the applicability of the Central Limit Theorem for this variable.
- Showing how various sampling methods can be used on your data and  What conclusions are
 if these samples are used instead of the whole data set.
- Using Data wrangling techniques for the appropriate analysis of your data if needed.
